# Feature scaling is a technique to standardize the independant features present in the data in a fix range
# The distance between the new data point and the centroid can be calculated with the following methods:
# Euclidean Distance: It is the square root of the sum of squares of differences between the coordinates
# Manhattan Distance: It is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between the coordinates (feature values) 
# of data point and centroid of each class. 

# If an algorithm is not using the feature scaling method then it can consider the value 3000 meters to be greater 
# than 5 km but thatâ€™s actually not true and in this case, the algorithm will give wrong predictions. 
# So, we use Feature Scaling to bring all values to the same magnitudes and thus, tackle this issue.
