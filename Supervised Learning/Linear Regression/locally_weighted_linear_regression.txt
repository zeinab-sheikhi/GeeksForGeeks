when the relationship between the X and y is non-linear, the locally
weighted linear regresison is used.
It is a non-parametric algorithm.
There exists No training phase.
All the work is done during the testing phase/while making predictions.
Locally weighted regression methods are a generalization of k-Nearest Neighbour.
In a Non-Parametric Algorithm, you always have to keep the data and the parameters in your computer memory to make predictions.
And thatâ€™s why this type of algorithm may not be great if you have a really really massive dataset.
